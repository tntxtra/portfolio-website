      <h2>What are your hobbies?</h2>
      <p>My favorite hobby is building computer systems. It can be relaxing and frustrating at the same time but very rewarding. Helping everyday people become free from the burdens of finance.</p>
      <p>I also exercise my body and problem solving skill with my other love Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which is a predominantly ground-based martial art, using the principals of leverage, angles, pressure and timing, as well as knowledge of the human anatomy, in order to achieve a non-violent submission of one's opponent </p>
      <p>The mind needs to remain sharp, for that I use chess. Chess helps improve problem solving skills, as well as strategy planning.</p>       
      <h2>What's your favorite snack</h2>
        <p> Acai bowls, definitely Acai bowls, or steak nachos. yeah, that is going to be a tie!</p>

      <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
      <p>My dream job is being able to freely move through the world, building software solutions that resolve hardware problems. Besides tech stuff I would spend my days drinking coffee, energy drinks and petting dogs </p>
      
      <h2>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h2>
      <p>Because programming provides the bridge between hardware and software. Developing one without further understanding of the other, limits the possibilities of both. The truth is that one cannot succeed without the other.</p>
      <h2>What is a big project you would like to be involved in?</h2>
      <p> I would be open to the AI scene. I think we are deep in there already but in my opinion it is more about issues with safety than functionality. That is why we still have a "dumb" alexa.</p>
