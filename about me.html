      <h1>More About Me</h1>
      <h2>What are your hobbies?</h2>
      <p>My favorite hobby is building computer systems that help everyday people become free from the burdens of life.</p>
      <p>I also excercise my body and problem solving skill with my other love Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which is a predominantly ground-based martial art, using the principals of leverage, angles, pressure and timing, as well as knowledge of the human anatomy, in order to achieve a non-violent submission of one's opponent </p>
      <h2>What's your favorite snack</h2>
        <p> Acai bowls, definitely Acai bowls, or steak nachos. yeah, that is going to be a tie!</p>

      <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
      <p>My dream job is being able to freely move tghrough the world, building software solutions that rersolve hardware problems. Besides tech stuff I would spend my days drinking coffee, energy drinks and petting dogs </p>
      
      <h2>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h2>
      <p>Because programming provides the bridge between hardware and sofware. Developing one without futher understanding of the other, limits the possibilities of both. The truth is that one cannot succeed withouth the other.</p>
      <h2>What is a big project you would like to be involved in?</h2>
      <p> I would be open to the AI scene. I think we are deep in there already but in my opinion it is more about issues with safety than funtionality. That is why we still have a "dumb" alexa.</p>
